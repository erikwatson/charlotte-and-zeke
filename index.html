        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 75px;">We are Charlotte &amp; Zeke, video editors, artists and animator for hire!</p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2 id="videos">VIDEOS</h2>
          <p>We have been editing videos for years, with Zeke starting back in college, where his editing skills  and hard work earned him a distinction and 2 academic awards. </p>
          <p>Charlotte starting with our personal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/charlotteandzeke">YouTube channel</a> back in 2018 and has worked hard to learn the skills in her own time. </p>
          <p>Our personal channel's main focus is on Let's Play videos, as a way to keep our post production skills sharp we tend to cut/make additions to these personal projects, meaning we're always warmed-up and ready to get creative with you and your video!</p>
          <p>We can cut together almost any kind video, so if you like what you see please feel free to <a href="/contact.html">Contact Us</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotAndZeke">follow us on Twitter!</a></p>
          <p>We primarily work using Davinci Resolve from Black Magic Studios. We also have experience with Sony Vegas and Final Cut Pro.</p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2 id="art">ART</h2>
          <p>Charlotte &amp; Zeke have been drawing for as long as either of them can remember. Charlotte's art is typically more anime-influenced, while Zeke's is more inspired by cute cartoon art styles and GBA-era pixel art.</p>
          <p>Charlotte has been doing commissions online for years with many return customers on platforms such as <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/charlot-sweetie">deviantArt.</a> Charlotte has also become the clean-up artist for our Youtube Channel thumbnails, making her artistic talents invaluable to the team!</p>
          <p>Charlotte works in her spare time on personal comics and other story ideas, with a couple of short story being published and printed in Trial Run, a short stories comic book published by <a href="https://arledgecomics.com">Arledge Comics.</a> </p>
          <p>Charlotte can be found at:</p>

            <li><a href="https://charlot-sweetie.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Zeke has been animating in Flash since he was 13 years old, which has helped out a lot in both art and video editing, as Zeke has an eye for motion which has been honed over a lifetime. </p>
          <p>Zeke's art can mostly be found in his personal projects, such as the flash game <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/625504">Sky Panda</a>, which was played over 2 million times. Zeke's art can also be found on <a href="https://zekewatson.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a>, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/charlotteandzeke">Youtube Channel</a> and even this website!</p>
          <p>Moving from Flash animations to games and eventually pixel art and video editing, Zeke has a wide multi-media skillset that he aims to expand whenever he is able.</p>
